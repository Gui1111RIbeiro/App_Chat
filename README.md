# Project Description

This project was developed as part of my study on the flutter framework. I was curious how to develop a mobile app, so I started to study and develop many apps to improve. This project was created to learn about how chat works in apps, as I wanted to implement this in my shop project. So I created a chat with several users and managed to save each one's messages, in addition to generating notifications outside the application. Unfortunately I can't implement everything I created in the shop project, but nothing that is impossible to achieve, everything can be solved with a few changes, right?
